<h2>Web</h2>
<p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is application software for accessing the World Wide Web.
When a user follows the URL of a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content
from the website's web server and then displays the page on the user's device.</p>

<p>A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[1][2]
A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages,
a user must have a web browser installed.[3]</p>

<p>Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people used a browser.[4] The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 64% global market share
on all devices, followed by Safari with 19%.[5]</p>
